A simple [Postfix](https://www.postfix.org/ "Postfix Homepage") SMTP TLS relay docker [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine "Alpine Linux Image") based image with no local authentication enabled (to be run in a secure LAN).

## About Postfix
**Disclaimer:** I am just the maintainer of this docker container, I did not write the software. Visit the [Official Homepage](https://www.postfix.org/ "Postfix Homepage") to thank the author(s)! :)

**Info:** I originally forked this repositofy from [Juan Luis Baptiste](https://github.com/juanluisbaptiste/ "Juan Luis Baptiste"). Thank you for your work! :)

What is Postfix? It is Wietse Venema's mail server that started life at IBM research as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail program. After eight years at Google, Wietse continues to maintain Postfix.

Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and secure. The outside has a definite Sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

## Image, Versions and Architecture

I built this image based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine "Alpine Linux Image").

There will always be two different versions:

| Tag | Content |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Latest    | Contains the latest stable version |
| x.x.x     | Contains the Postfix and Alpine versions mentioned at the bottom of the page and in the release notes | 

I am using semantic versioning for this image. For all supported architectures there are the following versioned tags:

* Major (1)
* Minor (1.0)
* Patch (1.0.0)
* Latest

There are also several platforms supported:

Platform:
* linux/amd64
* linux/386
* linux/arm64
* linux/arm/v6
* linux/arm/v7

---

## Usage

To start the container you can run the following:

```
docker run -d --name postfix -p "25:25"  \
        -e SMTP_SERVER=your.mail.server \
        -e SERVER_HOSTNAME=your.mail.server \
        bleala/postfix:latest
```

But since docker compose is easier to maintain, I'll give you a valid docker compose example:


```docker compose.yml
version: "3.9"

networks:
  postfix:
    name: postfix
    driver: bridge

secrets:
  smtp_password:
    file: /path/to/your/secret/file/smtp_password

services:

  postfix:
    image: bleala/postfix:latest

    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    environment:
      # Mandatory: Server address of the SMTP server to use.
      SMTP_SERVER:
      # Optional: (Default value: 587) Port address of the SMTP server to use.
      SMTP_PORT: 
      # Optional: Username to authenticate with.
      SMTP_USERNAME:
      # Optional (Mandatory if SMTP_USERNAME is set): Password of the SMTP user. (Not needed if SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE is used)
      SMTP_PASSWORD:
      # Mandatory: Server hostname for the Postfix container. Emails will appear to come from the hostname's domain.
      SERVER_HOSTNAME:
      # Optional: This will add a header for tracking messages upstream. Helpful for spam filters. Will appear as "RelayTag: ${SMTP_HEADER_TAG}" in the email headers.
      SMTP_HEADER_TAG:
      # Optional: Setting this will allow you to add additional, comma seperated, subnets to use the relay. Used like SMTP_NETWORKS='xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx'.
      SMTP_NETWORKS:
      # Optional: Set this to a mounted file containing the password, to avoid passwords in env variables.
      SMTP_PASSWORD_FILE:
      # Optional: Set this to yes to always add missing From:, To:, Date: or Message-ID: headers.
      ALWAYS_ADD_MISSING_HEADERS: yes
      # Optional: This will rewrite the from address overwriting it with the specified address for all email being relayed.
      OVERWRITE_FROM: "Your Name <email@company.com>"
      # Optional: This will use allow you to set a custom $mydestination value. Default is localhost.
      DESTINATION:
      # Optional: This will output the subject line of messages in the log.
      LOG_SUBJECT: yes
      # Optional: This will disable (no) or enable (yes) the use of SMTPUTF8
      SMTPUTF8_ENABLE: no
      # Optional: This will use allow you to set a custom $message_size_limit value. Default is 10240000.
      MESSAGE_SIZE_LIMIT:
    env_file:
      - .env
    networks:
      postfix:
    ports:
      - target: 25
        published: 25
        protocol: tcp
        mode: host
    secrets:
      - smtp_password
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /etc/localtime
        target: /etc/localtime
        read_only: true
```

You can start the docker-compose.yml with the following command

```
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to see the container logs, you can run

```
docker compose logs -f
```

or

```
docker logs -f postfix
```

#### Google specifics

Gmail by default [does not allow email clients that don't use OAUTH 2](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/new-security-measures-will-affect-older.html) for authentication (like Thunderbird or Outlook). First you need to enable access to "Less secure apps" on your
[google settings](https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps).

Also take into account that email `From:` header will contain the email address of the account being used to
authenticate against the Gmail SMTP server (SMTP_USERNAME), the one on the email will be ignored by Gmail unless you [add it as an alias](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370).

### Debugging
If you need troubleshooting the container you can set the environment variable `DEBUG=yes` for a more verbose output.
